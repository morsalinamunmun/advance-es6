//p-1: You have an odd array (array with odd numbers). [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].Now convert this array into an even array (array with even numbers). [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]. Do this using for loop & array.map() method. Hints: add one to any odd number and it wll become an even number.
/*p-2: You are given an array say:[33,50, 79, 78, 90, 101, 30]. Now return/get all the elements which are divisible by 10 using array.filter() method.                                                           
Now do the same task of question 2. but do this using array.find() method. then compare the output of question 2 & question 3. */     
/*p-3: You have an array of objects:                              
const instructor = [
    {name: 'Nodi', age: 28, position: 'Senior'},
    {name: 'Akil', age: 26, position: 'Junior'},
    {name: 'Shobuj', age: 30, position: 'Senior'}
]
your task is to display the instructor names that has the position senior using filter*/

/*p-3: const people= [
    {name: 'Meena', age: 20},
    {name: 'Rina', age: 15},
    {name: 'Shuci', age: 22},
];
1. follow above array of objects. o, you have 3 objects as array element. Can you find out the total sum from here?
20 + 15 + 22 = 57. The output will be 57
what are you thinking? yeah! Do the some task using array.reduce() method.*/
